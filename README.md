# Gaussian_Blurring_2D_and_1D
Python code for Gaussian blurring of images using 2D and 1D kernels. This code doesn't use any existing functions of OpenCV.
This code shows the implementation of the 2D and 1D gaussian blurring on an image.
This could be used as a building block for further development.
